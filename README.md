# üè´ Comprehensive School Management System (Microservices Architecture ‚Äì .NET + Azure)

## Overview

This platform is a **comprehensive, cloud-based school management system** designed to unify all institutional operations ‚Äî administration, academics, finance, communication, and parent engagement ‚Äî under one modular architecture.

The system is built using:
- **Backend:** C# .NET (microservices architecture)
- **Database:** Azure SQL Database (normalized schema)
- **Messaging:** Azure Service Bus (event-driven)
- **Notifications:** Twilio (OTP, SMS, email)
- **Caching:** Azure Redis (OTP state, session cache)
- **Storage:** Azure Blob Storage (files, media)
- **Secrets & Keys:** Azure Key Vault

---

## üéØ Core Goals

- Centralize all school operations (Admin, Academic, Finance, Parent)
- Provide real-time access to data and analytics
- Ensure privacy and confidentiality of student information
- Support multi-school (multi-tenant) deployments
- Enforce secure authentication and authorization across user roles
- Integrate OTP-based MFA (especially for parents)

---

## üß± System Architecture

The system is split into independent **microservices**, each owning its own data store and responsibilities:

| Service | Description | Technology |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Auth Service** | Handles authentication, JWT issuance, password & OTP flows, MFA | ASP.NET Web API, Azure SQL, Redis |
| **User Directory Service** | Manages users, roles, contacts, memberships, and invitations | ASP.NET Web API |
| **School Service** | Registers schools, classes, and academic catalogs | ASP.NET Web API |
| **Student Service** | Manages student profiles, enrollments, and join tokens | ASP.NET Web API |
| **Guardian Service** | Links parents to students; enforces OTP-based access | ASP.NET Web API |
| **Notification Service** | Integrates with Twilio for SMS/Email OTP and notifications | .NET Background Service |
| **Finance Service** | Handles fee records, transactions, receipts (future) | ASP.NET Web API |
| **Academics Service** | Manages grades, assignments, and attendance (future) | ASP.NET Web API |
| **Gateway/API Aggregator** | Secures and routes traffic between clients and services | YARP / Azure API Management |

All inter-service communication uses **Azure Service Bus topics** (publish/subscribe pattern).

## üîê Authentication & Roles

### User Types
- **System Administrator:** Creates schools and principals.
- **Principal/Deputy Principal:** Manage school staff and oversee operations.
- **Teachers:** Manage classes, assignments, and student assessments.
- **Accountants:** Manage fee transactions and receipts.

| Teachers/Staff | Password + TOTP | Invited by Principal/Deputy |
| Students | Password (initial = Admission No, must change) | Self-register via Enrollment |
| Parents | Password + OTP (or OTP-only) | Self-register via valid student link |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- Multi-tenant (supports multiple schools)
- OTP verification via Twilio for parents
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure JWT + refresh token authentication
- Staff invitations with one-time login links

## üß© Database Design (Azure SQL)

The system follows **3rd Normal Form (3NF)** ‚Äî every piece of data is stored exactly once, ensuring consistency and performance.  
Below is a summary of the **key tables per schema** (from the normalized ERD).

---

## üßÆ Normalization Summary

- **3NF** normalization ensures no redundant data.
- Each entity has its **own table** and uses **foreign keys** for relationships.
- **Lookup tables** (`Roles`, `Permissions`) are referenced by `UserSchoolMemberships`.
- **Soft deletion** and **status fields** used instead of hard deletes for audit consistency.
- High-read tables (e.g., `Enrollments`, `Memberships`, `Users`) have **covering indexes** on `SchoolId`, `Status`.

---

## üß© Entity Relationships (Simplified)

- `Users` ‚Üî `Usernames` (1-many)
- `Users` ‚Üî `Contacts` (1-many)
- `Users` ‚Üî `UserSchoolMemberships` ‚Üî `Schools` (many-many)
- `Users(Student)` ‚Üî `Students` ‚Üî `Enrollments` ‚Üî `Classes`
- `Users(Parent)` ‚Üî `GuardianLinks` ‚Üî `Students`
- `Users(Staff)` ‚Üî `Invitations` (1-many)
- `Schools` ‚Üî `Classes` (1-many)
- `Enrollments` ‚Üî `JoinTokens` (1-many)

## üîê Authentication Flow Summary

1. **System Admin** creates schools and principals.
2. **Principal/Deputy** invites teachers, accountants, etc.
3. **Students** self-register using admission/UPI + DoB or join token.
4. **Parents** self-register using verified phone/email and child‚Äôs info.
5. **Parents** login with **password + OTP** or **OTP-only** for maximum security.
